# My Schema Extension for Quarto

## Installing

```bash
quarto add template kai-prince-sfhea/Schema
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

*TODO*: Describe how to use your format.

## Structure
1. Pre-render data from files and create master json file.
2. Filter applied to each file to create a filtered json file only containing relevant data for each file.
3. Post-render data for each file to create a json file of files that mention it.

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [example.qmd](example.qmd).

## Future
Set up a system for LEAN verification of proofs.
