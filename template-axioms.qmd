## Introduction
::: {.definition}
::: {#def-associativity include-alias="true"}
For all ${#1},{#2},{#3}$ in $\Set$, one has $\Operation{(\Operation{#1}{#2})}{#3}=\Operation{#1}{(\Operation{#2}{#3})}$.
:::
::: {#def-identity include-alias="true"}
There exists an element $\Identity$ in $\Set$ such that, for every ${#1}$ in $\Set$, one has $\Operation{\Identity}{#1}={#1}$ and $\Operation{#1}{\Identity}={#1}$. Such an element is unique and is called the **identity element**.
:::
::: {#def-unique-inverse include-alias="true"}
::: {#def-inverse include-alias="true"}
For each ${#1}$ in $\Set$, there exists an element ${#2}$ in $\Set$ such that $\Operation{#1}{#2}=\Identity$ and $\Operation{#2}{#1}=\Identity$, where $\Identity$ is the identity element.
:::
For each ${#1}$, the element ${#2}$ is unique and is called the **inverse** of ${#2}$ and is denoted $\Inverse{#1}$.
