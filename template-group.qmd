## Introduction
::: {#def-group}
A group is a non-empty set $\Group$ together with a binary operation on $\Group$, denoted "$\GroupOperation{}{}$", that combines any two elements $\GroupElement$ and $\GroupElement'$ of $\Group$ to form an element of $\Group$, denoted $\GroupOperation{\GroupElement}{\GroupElement'}$, such that the following three requirements, known as **group axioms**, are satisfied:

* @def-associativity.
* @def-identity.
* @def-unique-inverse.
