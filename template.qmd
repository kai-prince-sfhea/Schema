# Introduction

::: {#def-associativity templateMap="[\\Set,\\Operation,\\Identity]"}
## associativity

For all ${#1},{#2},{#3}$ in $\Set$, one has $\Operation{(\Operation{#1}{#2})}{#3}=\Operation{#1}{(\Operation{#2}{#3})}$.
:::

::: {#def-identity templateMap="[\\Set,\\Operation,\\Identity]"}
## identity
There exists an element $\Identity$ in $\Set$ such that, for every ${#1}$ in $\Set$, one has $\Operation{\Identity}{#1}={#1}$ and $\Operation{#1}{\Identity}={#1}$. Such an element is unique and is called the *identity element*.
:::

:::: {#def-Inverse templateMap="[\\Set,\\Operation,\\Identity]"}
## unique inverse
For each ${#1}$ in $\Set$, there exists an element ${#2}$ in $\Set$ such that $\Operation{#1}{#2}=\Identity$ and $\Operation{#2}{#1}=\Identity$, where $\Identity$ is the identity element.

For each ${#1}$, the element ${#2}$ is unique and is called the *inverse* of ${#2}$ and is denoted $\Inverse{#1}$.
